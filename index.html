            <h4>Aesop Facial Appointments are available at select doors across the globe.</h4>
            <p> Since Aesop’s inception, we have maintained a fiercely independent approach to product research and development. Our team of skilled chemical scientists works out of our Head Office in a utilitarian, custom-built laboratory – conceptualising product ideas, researching blends, and creating prototypes.

            We source ingredients from the most reputable suppliers across the globe, then marry contemporary technology with long-established scientific practices.

            We launch new products only in response to genuine needs expressed by our clients, and only after extensive research delivers formulations of the highest quality and efficacy.</p>

            <h4>The genuine article</h4>
            <p> We wish to warn our clients that there are imitation Aesop products on the market. Our unwelcome admirers are selling their wares in packaging designed to closely resemble our own.

            Our products are available only at Aesop signature stores and department store counters, select stockists, and Aesop Online. You will know you are purchasing a genuine Aesop product also by virtue of the label and by the care you receive. When you buy Aesop you will be served by staff who are gracious, well-informed and worldly – people who, unlike our imitators, get it. </p>
